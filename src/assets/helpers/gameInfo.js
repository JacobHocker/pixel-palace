        history: "The first playable version of Tetris was created on June 6, 1984 by Alexey Pajitnov of the Soviet Union. In 1988 Nintendo gained access to the rights of Tetris and brought it to the masses where it sold millions of copies for the GameBoy and many other platforms.",
        objective: "In most versions, the speed of the falling pieces increases with each level. The player can clear multiple lines at once. If the player cannot make the blocks disappear quickly enough, the field will start to fill; when the pieces reach the top of the field and prevent the arrival of additional pieces, the game ends. At the end of each game, the player receives a score based on the number of lines that have been completed. The game never ends with the player's victory. The player can complete only as many lines as possible, before an inevitable loss.",
